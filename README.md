# System Overview
We decided to create a simulation model to determine the probability of a person leaving Lloyds Bank based on factors such as age,income, averaage savings, average pension value, years with the bank etc. We take one simulated customer and see how their behaviour and likeliness to leave the bank changes over time. We split the customers age ranges then gathered and recorded data on these factors in that age range. The user will input their age and the programme will calculate
