# Pension_Predictor
# System Overview
We decided to create a simulation model to determine the probability of a person within the pension business leaving Lloyds Bank based on factors such as age,income, average savings, average pension value, years with the bank etc. We create a diverse demographic of people within a given age and see how their behaviour and likeliness to leave the bank changes over time. In addition to this, we present a simulated customer and show their likeliness over a set period of time. We also display the trends based on the data set for data analysis purposes. We split the customers into set age ranges then gathered and recorded data on these factors in that age range. The user will input their age and using nueral networks we analyse other customers data within that age range from a created data set to determine the probability of them leaving the bank.

# Macroeconomics
Factors which we looked into that can effect the probability of a customer leaving Lloyds bank eg. interest rates, unemployment rate in their age bracket, economic growth. If interest rates are high it means customers get a greater return on their savings so they may have more of an incentive to stay with Lloyds bank if they have alot of savings. From our research we saw that those in older age categories (50+) had a higher percentage of savings compared to younger age categories. As for unemployment rates if they are high in certain age groups it increases the probability that an individual in tha age category might be unemployed making them more likely to leave Lloyds bank as they aren't saving as much.
